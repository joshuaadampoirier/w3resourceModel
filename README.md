# Overview
This project represents w3resource's Model database (see more 
[here](https://www.w3resource.com/sql/sql-table.php)) in source control. It is 
represented here as a **SQLite3** database and may be deployed via the 
[jp-migrator](https://github.com/joshuaadampoirier/jp-migrator). 
tool.  

The database is intended to be a small, simple example of how the 
**jp-migrator** tool can be used to deploy a database. There are three table 
definition files, whose tables are populated by three respective migration 
scripts.
